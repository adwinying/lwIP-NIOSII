# lwIP-NIOSII

lwIP running on bare metal on DE2-115.

Other sample programs are included in `FPGA/software/`:
- `FreeLwIP`: lwIP running on top of FreeRTOS (not working). Sourced from (here)[https://github.com/EngineeringSpirit/FreeLwIP-Nios-II]
- `hello_world`: Simple hello world test program. Just to make sure hardware is configured correctly.
- `lwIP_NIOS_II_Example`: lwIP bare metal sample program.
- `sss`: Simple Socket Server sample program. If SSS works, then `lwIP_NIOS_II_Example` should work as well.
